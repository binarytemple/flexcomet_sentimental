CometClient is the Bayeux client library, CometChat is a sample MXML chat app that uses CometClient to communicate with the chat example in the Jetty cometd (see http://jetty.mortbay.org and http://cometd.org).  They are checked in as FlexBuilder 2.0 projects.  Create a workspace in FB2 and importing them is the easiest way to build.

For command line building, the main thing you need to account for is the dependency on corelib (see http://code.google.com/p/as3corelib/).
